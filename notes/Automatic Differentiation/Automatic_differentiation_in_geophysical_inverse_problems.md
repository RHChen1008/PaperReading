### 2. Problem to solve:

The computation of gradients/derivatives holds paramount significance across various scientific and engineering domains. From the perspective of sensitivity analysis in forward modeling, gradients provide a quantitative measure of how model outputs respond to perturbations in input variables. This sensitivity information is crucial for understanding model behavior, optimizing model parameters, and assessing uncertainties. In the context of geophysical data inversion, particularly when dealing with a large number of unknown parameters and highly nonlinear relationships, the computation of gradients becomes exceedingly challenging. Traditional methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when the complexity of the problem increases. Moreover, manual derivation of gradients is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, especially when the underlying equations are intricate. The process of translating these derivations into engineering code and debugging them further exacerbates the problem. This approach lacks flexibility, as any changes in conditions necessitate a complete re-derivation of analytical or numerical solutions. Additionally, numerical methods for gradient computation require a delicate balance between accuracy and grid resolution, which can significantly impact computational costs. 

An ideal differential method would address these challenges by providing accurate and efficient gradient computation, and enabling efficient optimization in complex geophysical inversion problems. It should also streamline the process of code implementation and debugging, thereby reducing time and resource expenditure while enhancing flexibility and adaptability to changing conditions
   
### 3. Major contribution:
Automatic Differentiation technique can satisfy these three requirments, but to date (2007) AD seem to have made little impact on the Geosciences. The purpose of this paper is to help bring AD tools to the attention of the wider geoscience community, provide some useful references and illustrate its potential through a series of numerical experiments on common geoscience problems.
